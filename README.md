## ✦ Key Architectural Modules

### 🛍️ Artisan Marketplace
An immersive storefront featuring fluid collection sorting (`Sarees`, `Plain Cloth`, `Towels`, `Dhupattas`). It comes equipped with dynamic multi-image carousels and smooth micro-interactions that emphasize artisan textures.

### 🧾 Context-Aware WhatsApp Checkout
A highly optimized, serverless booking workflow that transforms stateful client cart data into itemized, high-fidelity message invoices. It securely commits data payloads to a cloud ledger before natively transitioning users to direct administrative chats (`wa.me`) with active live preview assets.

A protected, back-office command center enabling instant operations control:
* **Inventory Publishing:** Live multi-photo file processing using distributed content networks.
* **Telemetry Toggles:** Instant one-click warehouse stock updates that immediately reflect site-wide.
* **Layout Orchestration:** Custom control interfaces to dynamically map and refresh home page curated highlights and banner queues.
